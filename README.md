Project: Virtual Classroom Web Application

This project is a **Virtual Classroom** platform that allows administrators or instructors to manage classes, units (books), and sessions (chapters), while providing students with access to course materials and a real-time discussion forum. The platform is designed to facilitate seamless online learning with features like class management, student enrollment, and interactive discussions on lecture

Key Features:
Class Management: Admins or instructors can create and manage classes, units, and sessions.
Student Enrollment: Students can enroll in classes and access only the materials for which they are enrolled.
Course Material Access: Students can view course materials such as lecture notes, videos, and assignments within each session.
Nested Commenting: Users can engage in discussions under lectures with nested replies, making conversations easy to follow.
Real-Time Updates: Discussions are updated in real-time, allowing users to see new comments instantly (via Socket.IO).

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express to handle server-side logic and API requests.
Database: MySQL for structured data (classes, units, and sessions), MongoDB for unstructured data (nested comments).
Authentication: JWT for secure access control.
Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO for real-time updates in discussions.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to build a scalable and interactive virtual classroom solution, suitable for educational institutions and online learning environments.# Virtual-Classroom
